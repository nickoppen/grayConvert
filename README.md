WIP:

A simple OpenCV based gray scale image converter.

To convert the image to a comma separated text file of gray values:

./grey2text.x <image.tif> [-o values.csv]

To convert it back to an image

./text2grey.x <textFile.csv -o imagefile.tif

(I know that I've spelt GRAY incorrectly throughout. I'll correct it eventually)
